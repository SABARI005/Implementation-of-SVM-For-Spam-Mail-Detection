# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
-Collect a labeled dataset of emails, distinguishing between spam and non-spam.

-Preprocess the email data by removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase, removing stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization.

-Extract features from the preprocessed text using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF.

-Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.

-Train an SVM model using the training set, selecting the appropriate kernel function and hyperparameters.

-Evaluate the trained model using the test set, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

-Optimize the model's performance by tuning its hyperparameters through techniques like grid search or random search.

-Deploy the trained and fine-tuned model for real-world use, integrating it into an email server or application.

-Monitor the model's performance and periodically update it with new data or adjust hyperparameters as needed.
